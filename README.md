# auto-build-RTK
Automate the building of OpenRTK for a Linux machine.
It simply follows the installation tutorial that can be found [here](http://wiki.openrtk.org/index.php/Main_Page#Step_0_-_Getting_ITK).


How to use it: 
- Create an empty directory that will hosts all the OpenRTK and ITK sources.
- Download this [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/downloads/dannylessio/auto-build-RTK/master/auto_build_RTK.sh) and put it in the new folder just created.
- Give the execution privileges to the .sh script.
- Execute it.
- Enter the number of cores of your processor, this is a tip for speedup the compilation process.
- Hope, and take a long coffee.
